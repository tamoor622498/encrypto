# encrypto
A cryptology game. I had this idea when I was learning the basics of C++ in school. The game loads in phrases from a text file and encrypts them. The user is then suppoesed to strategically guess the value of each character. This program does use unicode, make sure to have it enabled in whatever envirnoment your running the game in.
